# Contributors

_This document only contains the contributions for the second sprint._

## Adrian Salazar
### Tasks
- Parsing Node Manipulations in C

### Major Files
- `graph_lib.py,` `Everything except add edge`
- `graph_lib.cpp,` `Everything except add edge`

## Enzo E. Dominguez
### Tasks
- Parsing CSV Data for Node Descriptions and Edges

### Major Files
- `csv_parser.py,` `270 lines`
- `csv_parser.cpp,` `79 lines`

Enzo worked on parsing the node descriptions and edges through c for optimal performance. 

Fixed some miscellaneous bug primarily in `views.py`.

## Adithya Haridas
### Tasks
- Download functionality
- Interactive graphs

### Major Files
- `*.html`
- `graph_dash.py` `Everything except shortest path`
- `views.py`

Adithya mainly worked on getting the new interactive graph ported from the Flask-based Plotly Dash framework over to our Django project. Since this required major structural change, he also designed the changes required for the internal state system.

After his assigned work was complete, he went around fixing bugs and contributing small parts to other people's work.


## Daniel Giampaolo
### Tasks
- Error handling

### Major Files
- `views.py`
- `graph_dash.py,` `Shortest path`
- `*.html`

Daniel primarily worked on graph v1 generation, the shortest path interactions, error handling, and some front-end clean up. 

Once the bulk of the error handling was plumbed, he attempted to contribute bits to others work and began the merging of the groups independent efforts, ironing out some overlapping code and preparing for the final push to master.


## Pratik Gajjar
### Tasks
- Node to Node routing in C `No usable work`

### Major Files
- `None committed`
