## Enzo E. Dominguez
### Tasks
- Parsing CSV Data for Node Descriptions and Edges

### Major Files

Enzo worked on parsing the node descriptions and edges through c for optimal performance.

## Adithya Haridas
### Tasks
- Download functionality
- Interactive graphs

### Major Files
- `*.html`
- `graph_dash.py` `Everything except shortest path`
- `views.py`

Adithya mainly worked on getting the new interactive graph ported from the Flask-based Plotly Dash framework over to our Django project. Since this required major structural change, he also designed the changes required for the internal state system.

After his assigned work was complete, he went around fixing bugs and contributing small parts to other people's work.
